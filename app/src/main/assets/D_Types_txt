Types of depression
There are several forms of depression. Below are some of the most common types.
Major depression
A person with major depression experiences a constant state of sadness. They may lose interest in activities that they used to enjoy.
Treatment usually involves medication and psychotherapy.
Persistent depressive disorder
Also known as dysthymia, persistent depressive disorder causes symptoms that last for at least 2 years.
A person with this disorder may have episodes of major depression as well as milder symptoms.
Bipolar disorder
Depression is a common symptom of bipolar disorder, and research shows that people with this disorder may have symptoms around half of the time. This can make bipolar disorder hard to distinguish from depression.
Psychotic depression
Some people experience psychosis with depression.
Psychosis can involve delusions, such as false beliefs and a detachment from reality. It can also involve hallucinations — sensing things that do not exist.
Postpartum depression
After giving birth, many women experience what some people call the “baby blues.” When hormone levels readjust after childbirth, changes in mood can result.
Postpartum depression, or postnatal depression, is more severe.
There is no single cause for this type of depression, and it can persist for months or years. Anyone who experiences ongoing depression after delivery should seek medical attention.
Major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern
Previously called seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, this type of depression is related to the reduction in daylight during the fall and winter.
It lifts during the rest of the year and in response to light therapy.
People who live in countries with long or severe winters seem to be affected more by this condition.
