Signs
There are several signs that you might be someone prone to emotional eating.
Sudden, urgent cravings. Physical hunger develops slowly over time. “After you eat, you may be satisfied for a while and then your hunger is going to grow,” says Dr. Albers. “You desire a variety of different foods, you feel the sensation of fullness and you can track feeling more satisfied or full as you’re eating.” Emotional eating, in contrast, comes on suddenly and might have urgency, she notes. “You say, ‘I need to eat something. I need some chocolate.’
Craving only certain foods. Not only do your cravings come on suddenly, but you might only want to eat certain foods. “If you’re saying to yourself, ‘I don’t want to just eat something because I’m hungry. I want chocolate, and that’s all that’s going to satisfy me,’ it’s a red flag of emotional eating,” says Dr. Albers.
Overeating. Overeating is another hallmark of emotional eating. “The sensation that a lot of my clients talk about is wanting that food to make them feel better or satisfied. No matter how much they eat, it never really brings them to that feeling until they feel sick or overly full and then they stop eating,” says Dr. Albers. “But they’re hoping that as they’re eating, it’s going to change their sensation in some way.”
Shame or guilt. Feeling emotional distress, like shame or guilt, over your eating habits is another sign.
