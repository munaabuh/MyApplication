Causes
The causes of anxiety disorders are complicated. Many might occur at once, some may lead to others, and some might not lead to an anxiety disorder unless another is present.
Possible causes include:
environmental stressors, such as difficulties at work, relationship problems, or family issues
genetics, as people who have family members with an anxiety disorder are more likely to experience one themselves
medical factors, such as the symptoms of a different disease, the effects of a medication, or the stress of an intensive surgery or prolonged recovery
brain chemistry, as psychologists define many anxiety disorders as misalignments of hormones and electrical signals in the brain
withdrawal from an illicit substance, the effects of which might intensify the impact of other possible causes
Symptoms
While a number of different diagnoses constitute anxiety disorders, the symptoms of generalizes anxiety disorder (GAD) will often include the following:
restlessness, and a feeling of being “on-edge”
uncontrollable feelings of worry
increased irritability
concentration difficulties
sleep difficulties, such as problems in falling or staying asleep
While these symptoms might be normal to experience in daily life, people with GAD will experience them to persistent or extreme levels. GAD may present as vague, unsettling worry or a more severe anxiety that disrupts day-to-day living.
