Hello, welcome to Sanctum, we are very pleased you chose us!
So how about we get to know each other?
Firstly, let us explain our name, Sanctum means sanctuary or safe holy place,
the reason we chose this to be our name in order for for it to feel like a welcoming cozy place for our dear beloved users
for the main reason behind the creation of this app is to help people feel like they have someone that understands them and feel like their feelings matter.
Secondly, let us talk about our mission, our main purpose is to create a safe place for people to find others whom can help them, to find the information needed for them to educate themselves,
in addition we aim to give people the space to express their thoughts and emotions (or maybe even write what goes on in their minds during anxiety or panic attacks) for them to share later in their therapy sessions.
Lastly, we would love to share with you some of our values, here at Sanctum we aim to welcome everybody and help them embrace their thoughts, feeling and emotions.
We believe in being there for each other, furthermore we believe it to be incredibly important to be upfront with our users and do our best to provide them with the best of services,
that is why the subscription is free of charge.
Have great surfing my loves.
