Hello, my name is Muna Abu Hussein, I am 17 years old
a student at the Orthodox Arab College - Haifa
And I am the creator of Sanctum, now obviously did not create the whole app by my own ia m no Bill Gates
I am just one girl, I did do most of the work, however I did get some help (of the amazing miss Haneen) when fixing the errors and in figuring out how to read logcat and all the cool programing tricks
I hope you enjoy using my first ever app.
I love you all, happy surfing <3!
