Let's talk about security and privacy
When you use Sanctum, you place trust in out technology. That's why Sanctum aims to provide
a clear understanding of what data we process and why, what measures we take to
protect it, and how you can manage it.
Our approach to data processing
Purpose-specific data collection
We collect personal data only when it serves a specific, explicit and legitimate purpose. We donâ€™t collect data for any other purpose than the ones we have explicitly stated in our Privacy Policy.

Being transparent with you
We will inform you about the grounds and legal basis for collecting and processing your personal data. If it is required by law, we will ask your consent beforehand.

Never selling personal data
At no time has Flo ever sold user information, nor have we ever shared it with third parties for advertising purposes.

Protecting your data
We apply advanced security measures to protect personal data. Only a limited number of Flo employees have access to it.
